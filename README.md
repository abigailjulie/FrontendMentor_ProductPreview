## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I struggled with switching from the horizontal to vertical view based on the width of the screen. Figuring out how to show and hide things while maintaining padding and margins was difficult but I am glad I was able to figure it out.

### Continued development

Technique used in this challenge of creating a preview of a product to add to cart that is responsive, is incredibly important. I look forward to gaining more comfortabiliy.
